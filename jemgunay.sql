The <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org">SFML</a> library was used to draw the planets in the simulation. Planet Earth is fixed to the centre of space, with a variable number of square and triangular satellites orbiting around it; for each satellite spawned, an impulse sized relative to the distance from the central planet is applied to launch it in a random direction, but with a velocity which guides the satellite into a stable orbit. I decided to use an abstract but clean style to make the simulation more interesting and satisfying to watch.</p>\n<br>\n<p>There are options to create and destroy satellites, which can in turn be dragged around with the mouse - a challenge is to try and throw the satellites back into a successful orbit. There are also controls for zooming and enabling/disabling the gravitational field which creates a gradual scattering effect.

(8, 'Bagel Turret: Remote Surveillance Turret (Part 1)', '<p>Me and my flat mates were fooling around with some cheap BB guns and an epic idea dawned on me: to build an automatic surveillance turret! I wanted to develop a web interface for controlling the aiming and firing of the turret and could then apply computer vision technologies to detect and aim for specific targets to test the accuracy of the gun.</p>\n<br>\n<p>I dug out my old childhood <a href="http://www.meccano.com">Meccano </a> set which would be used to construct a frame to mount the gun and electronics onto. I searched online for a cheap electric BB gun that would be easy to modify; I went with this automatic <a href="https://www.justbbguns.co.uk/product/bb-guns-4-fun/bb-electric/2431/cyber-stryke-x4-bb-gun">“CYBER STRYKE X4 BB GUN" </a> as it was cheap and had a semi-transparent housing, meaning I would be able to locate the electronics and firing mechanisms with ease. Having experimented with <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> on my old original Raspberry Pi, I soon realised that if I wanted to stream the turret’s view to a web interface in real time with minimum lag, as well as perform object classification/detection, I would have to invest in a Raspberry Pi 3 which has significantly more processing power. I already had a NOIR Pi Camera which I will use for now to stream the turret''s view - I may get a standard Pi Camera when I reach the computer vision implementation phase as the colourisation from the IR light may impact upon accuracy.</p>\n<br>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4">\n        <img class="img-responsive img-shadow img-modal" src="content/turret/frame1.jpg" alt="Original BB gun">\n    </div>\n    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4">\n        <img class="img-responsive img-shadow img-modal" src="content/turret/frame2.jpg" alt="Recently cut wood pieces for the base support">\n    </div>\n    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4">\n        <img class="img-responsive img-shadow img-modal" src="content/turret/frame3.jpg" alt="Finished wood base support">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<p>A cheap hobby motor was used to control the horizontal rotation and a servo was used to control the vertical aiming. I hacked together a couple of gears to reduce the load on the motor and glue-gunned a retractable arm to the servo and attached the other end to the gun, allowing the arm to extend and retract when the servo changes orientation. The servo was wired directly to the Pi''s 5V output, though the motor required more power; by using an L293D Motor Driver IC, I was able to supply power via a 9V battery to the motor whilst providing easier control over the motor''s direction of rotation. Short python classes were then written to interface with the motor and servo, making it easier for me to test how well they functioned under the weight of the gun. The servo struggled to sustain the weight of the gun so I trimmed off the extra aesthetic plastic housing and removed the battery storage section towards the back – this can be repositioned elsewhere on the turret frame reducing the load on the servo. Despite these modifications, sharp movements caused the unstable Meccano base to wobble; I decided to build a new bottom base out of wood to structure the rest of the Meccano frame onto.</p>\n<br>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4">\n        <img class="img-responsive img-shadow img-modal" src="content/turret/frame4.jpg" alt="Close up of turret BB gun with Raspberry Pi and PiCamera mounted">\n    </div>\n    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4">\n        <img class="img-responsive img-shadow img-modal" src="content/turret/frame5.jpg" alt="Motor mechanism for horizontal rotation">\n    </div>\n    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4">\n        <img class="img-responsive img-shadow img-modal" src="content/turret/frame6.jpg" alt="Servo mechanism for vertical rotation">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<p>A further python script was then programmed to create a simple demo to show off the horizontal and vertical aiming capabilities - this can be seen in action below.

(9, 'Bagel Turret: Remote Surveillance Turret (Part 2)', '<p>Now that the framework for the turret movement was sorted, I moved onto the video streaming functionality. This was implemented by creating a web application using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> framework to serve the video stream one frame at a time to the user’s browser by reading an image from the Pi Camera and encoding it with appropriate headers before sending it as a response. When a user clicks a command button, a request is received by the server, and the desired action is carried out by the hardware manipulating Python classes such as stepping the servo to aim vertically, applying power to the motor to turn the turret horizontally or firing the gun. Basic access authentication is forced so that only users who have been provided with the username/password combination can access the turret’s stream.</p>\n<br>\n<p>In order to make connecting to the Raspberry Pi Flask server more straightforward, the Python script also sends a request to my external testing server which hosts a PHP script; this script logs the public IP address of the Pi and displays it to the user, allowing them to be able to access the turret’s stream (assuming the Pi is connected to a router which has its private IP port forwarded).

The Blender plug-in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/iboshkov/blender2ogre" target="_blank">"Blender RealXtend Tundra"</a> was then used to export the Blender mesh with UV co-ordinate data and the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ogre/files/ogre-tools/1.7.2/OgreCommandLineTools_1.7.2.zip" target="_blank">"OgreCommandLineTools 1.7.2"</a> set of scripts was used convert this into a ‘.mesh’ file to be rendered by the Ogre3D engine. Blender was also used to model and texture the cheese segment asset. I created an interpreter to parse game level creating instructions from a text file in order to make creating new levels more efficient without having to recompile the game each time. It ignores new lines and comment lines prefixed with a hash character; this improves readability by making it easy to group and label sections of wall creation instructions together. This project encouraged me to learn how to utilise Makefiles in order more efficiently build C++ programs.</p>\n<br>\n\n<div class="row">\n  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-offset-3 col-md-3">\n      <img class="img-responsive img-shadow img-modal" src="content/mousey_maze/screenshot5.jpg" alt="Mouse texture in Photoshop">\n  </div>\n  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3">\n      <img class="img-responsive img-shadow img-modal" src="content/mousey_maze/screenshot6.jpg" alt="Cheese texture UV mapped to the cheese segment mesh in Blender">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n\n<ul style="list-style-type:square">\n  <li><p>Execute "MazeGame" to launch the game.</p></li>\n	<li><p>WASD or arrow keys to roll the mouse.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Escape key to exit the game.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Built on Ubuntu 14.04.

I was tasked with producing a tool that searches a protein sequence for any matched motifs, providing the position of each motif found.  In particular, the tool had to detect regions of protein sequences which could form amyloid associations; these have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.</p>\n<br>\n<p>User provided input can consist of either a UniProt Accessor Code or a FASTA-Formatted Protein Sequence and will result in the output of the UniProt Accessor Code, the FASTA-Formatted Protein Sequence, the Protein Name and the corresponding Sequence Motif Matches. The tool has two main functions; the ability to search a singular protein sequence for patterns and the ability to search through a batch of protein sequences by their UniProt Accessor Codes all at once. For both functions, there are example inputs and options to clear input and output.
