            <p>Hey! I’m <b>Jem</b>, a software engineer living in central Manchester (UK) working remotely at Couchbase. Day to day, I primarily wield Golang to develop solutions to problems in the cloud; I have experience with both AWS and GCP cloud service providers and I'm a GCP certified Associate Cloud Engineer! In my previous role as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE, DevOps) I implemented systems to reduce toil, monitor infrastructure and report on service health. I also have experience writing highly available and scalable Go microservices with a strong emphasis on performance-optimising programming.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>I’ve had the opportunity to delve into other exciting and modern technologies such as Apache Kafka, InfluxDB and Vue.js to name a few, and I’m always curious about exploring new tech either at work or in my own time; I usually have several WIP personal software development projects on the go and my favourites are showcased on this site. Outside of work, I also love attending music events, bouldering and dabbling with 3D printing. Cheers!</p>
