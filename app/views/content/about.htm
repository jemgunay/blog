            <p>My name is <b>Jem Gunay</b> and I recently graduated from Keele University (UK) with a first class in Computer Science (BSc Hons). I have a great fascination for technology, in particular surrounding the fields of programming and security; I have always been curious as to how things work and how alterations can cause something to function differently than intended.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I like to keep up to date on tech news concerning developments and security, though am most intrigued by the lack of security throughout the cyber world and how in reality, nothing is safe. There are always several projects in working, and I intend to share and archive my best work and creations here.</p>

            <p>During the first year of secondary school I began to tinker with code, primarily in Flash AS2/AS3; this curiosity extended to VB.net, C++ and web languages such as PHP, JS and MySQL. In my first year at university I began to explore Java and Python development and became interested in electronics, creating simple ambient lighting and motor based projects with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I picked up 'Hacking: The Art of Exploitation' and 'Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide' which further enticed me into the world of hacking, leading me to investigate methods of exploitation and to delve into Linux distributions such as Debian and Kali in greater depth. I also enjoy dabbling in graphic design (Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, animation) which ties into my casual game development projects.</p>
